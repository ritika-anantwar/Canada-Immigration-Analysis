The dataset has been taken from 'IBM Skillbuild Data Visualization with Python' course. The dataset describes the Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013.

I have performed data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset using NumPy and Pandas libraries to identify key trends and patterns in Canadian immigration flows between 1980 and 2013. Matplotlib, a popular Python library is used for data visualization in order to visualize and uncover insights on immigrant demographics, geographic distribution, and socio-economic impact.
